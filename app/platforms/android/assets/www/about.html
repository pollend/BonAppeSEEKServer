                  Many children often have specific preferences with what foods he or she consumes, which makes food selection extremely difficult for parents. For instance, a child may only eat cuisine that are dry in texture, or salty in taste, or cannot mix textures at all. Because he or she is picky to eating a limited number of foods, the child may not receive necessary nutrients to maintain a healthy body and mind.

              BonAppéSEEK is designed for the parents and caregivers of children who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. It is intended to provide more food options for children that mimic their original preferences. This way, parents can introduce a healthier and bigger spectrum of food to these kids.<br><br>
                  Additionally, many low-functioning and nonverbal children face the difficulty of being able to communicate with their caregivers. This app includes an option of using a PEC (picture exchange communication) board for children to use. With this board, parents can select a certain amount of food products to display for their child. Their child now has the opportunity to select which food he or she wants, allowing more power and involvement for themselves.
